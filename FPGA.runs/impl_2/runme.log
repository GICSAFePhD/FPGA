Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
INFO: [Timing 38-35] Done setting XDC timing constraints.
WARNING: [Place 30-574] Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	reset_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y132
	reset_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
